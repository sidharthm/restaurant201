###Compilation/Running Instructions
  + The program runs normally without any extra conditions through Eclipse on my Win 7 64 bit PC.
  + Adding waiters is identical to adding waiters from v1, just type in a name and hit add. 
  + The timers have been programmed such that some tasks will take a large amount of time [such as eating salad or pizza].
    + There is a 1 sec pause between the Customer being seated and placing an order, the program is not hanging if that happens.
    + New customers are not seated until the waiter returns to his starting position. This can take time if the waiter is returning from the cook. 
  
###Issues
  + The pause button does not stop all messaging between agents, but does keep them from performing new actions. 
  + My attempts to format with Markdown for the design document resulted in some weird issues with reading the doc. All the content should be correct though.
